# First-Website
My first attempt to create a Website from scratch through HTML &amp; CSS.  

I had trouble pushing my repositary from my local cpu to github because I deleted and moved around the initial directories that were linked to this repository. I had to manually drop these files here. Henceforth, I think I can only modify from now these files here through github. Anyways, I am done with this project so it's not a big issue. I've learned to be careful when initially creating my link to github and creating local directories. 

Other than this everything went smoothly alhamdulillah.
